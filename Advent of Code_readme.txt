"Your tenacity for making things that make other things so that people can
make things is alarming." -a beta tester

Hi! I'm Eric Wastl. I made Advent of Code. I hope you like it! I also made
Vanilla JS, PHP Sadness, and lots of other things.
You can find me on Twitter and GitHub.

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of
skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an
expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just
learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts
that build on a theme.

If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by
helping to [Share] it with others, or directly via PayPal or bitcoin.

--- General Tips ---

If you get stuck, try your solution against the examples given in the puzzle;
you should get the same answers.

* If not, re-read the description. Did you misunderstand something?
* Is your program doing something you don't expect?
* After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct,
  build some test cases for which you can verify the answer by hand and see
  if those work with your program.
* If you're still stuck, maybe ask a friend for help, or come back to
  the puzzle later. You can also ask for hints in the subreddit.

If you really think your solution is correct but your answer isn't accepted,
and you think there might be a mistake in the puzzle itself because nobody
else is solving it either (check the stats page), let me know via Twitter.

My beta testers and I have checked the challenges pretty thoroughly, but
it's still possible that there's an error somewhere.
